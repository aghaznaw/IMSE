# Backlog Management System

This project implements a backlog management system designed for agile development environments. It facilitates the management of backlog items, releases, products, and sprints, with interactions between key roles such as Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and Developers.

## Key Features
- **Add, Update, and View Backlog Items**: Product Owners can add and update backlog items, while Developers can view them.
- **Assign Backlog Items**: Product Owners can assign backlog items to products, releases, and sprints, enabling better workflow management.
- **View Related Release Items**: Developers can view the release items associated with each backlog item to track progress.

## Architecture
The system follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach, dividing the application into distinct **bounded contexts**:
- **Backlog Context**: Manages backlog items.
- **Product Management Context**: Handles product-related information.
- **Release Management Context**: Manages releases.
- **Sprint Management Context**: Coordinates sprint information.
- **Task Management Context**: Manages tasks related to backlog items.

## Communication Between Contexts
Each context interacts via **RESTful APIs**, enabling smooth integration and ensuring the system's scalability and flexibility in managing agile workflows.
